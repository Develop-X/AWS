## Design Resilient Architecture

-  **Choose resilient/reliable storage** ```event of disaster you dont loose data or state```
- **Determine how to design decoupling mechanism using AWS services** ``` If one tier is failed others arent impacted because they are decoupled```
- **Determine how to design multi tier architecture** ```naturally decoupled, each tier scales independently```
- **Determine how to design high availability / fault tolerant systems.**

#### EC2 Instance Store
- **Ephemeral Volumes** ```( are lost when terminates/stops)```
- Only certain EC2 instances have instance stores
- Fixed Capacity (size is fixed)
- Disk type and capacity depends on EC2 instance type (SSD or HDD depends on instance type and so is capacity)
- Application level durability
- **Used for caching or storing other temporary data for fast access that can be replicated else where**

#### EBS (Elastic Block Storage)
- contrasts to EC2 instance store, this is attachable storage connects to 1 EC2 instance at a time.- 
- supports IOPS
- Indepndent lifecycle than EC2 instance (persist beyond lifetime of EC2 instance (advantage over EC2))
- attach mutiple EBS volumes to EC2 instance, however only one EC2 instance to EBS.
- multiple volumes attached can use RAID or striping to achieve higher throughput.
- Multiple volumes striped to create large volumes
- Encryption
- Snapshot

##### Types of EBS
- SSD (much better IOPS) (Good for random access)
- General purpose SSD (cheaper version)
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (better perf higher price)
- HDD (Better throughput , lower IOPS) (Good for sequential access) (cheaper)
- Throughput Optimized HDD (more expensive with better spes)
- Cold HDD 

#### EFS (Elastic File System)
- Mounting it as a disk similar to EBS
- EFS gives you shared storage, multiple EC2 instances can accsesss same storage
- Petabyte scale storage
- Capacity is elastics
- supports NFS4.0 and 4.1 , compatible with Linux based AMI, not supported by windows.

1. Create and EFS Volume
2. Create mount points in a particular VPC
3. The EFS volume can only attach a single VPC at a time.
4. Withing the VPC there are mount targets that EC2 connects to.

#### S3
- For object storage the primary option is S3
- S3 is implemented as distributed system
- Consistency Model - Strongly or Eventually?
- S3 gives you strong consistency for NO object, eventual consistency for updates.
- S3 gives you **storage classes**
- S3 Standard and S3 Standard IA(Infrequent access)
- S3 Standard is cheaper for access = uploads and downloads, S3 IA is expensive for access, cheaper for storage.
- Encryption for server side
- SSE-S3 is where s3 managed master key is used to encrypt files on server side.
- SSE-KMS is where KMS managed master keys are used to encrypt files on server side.
- SSE-C s where customer provided master keys are used to encrypt files on server side.
- S3 uses https
- Allows versioning on a bucket
- Control access through IAM, bucket policies, user policies, ACL (access control lists)
- S3 supports multi-part uploads
- Internet accessible API, unlimited capacity and reigon scoped

#### Amazon Glacier
- Solution for data backup and archive storage, eg financial statements for cold storage
- archives correspond to files and vaults which are collection of archives
- 3 Retrievals types - **Expedited, Standard and Bulk**
- Bulk is cheapest and can take upto 12 hours
- Expedited expensive, takes upto 5 mins
- Glacier encrypts data by default.
- Have lifecycle policies on s3 , which take auto backup after a period of time.
- Has reigonal availability.

#### De-coupling of services
- If server goes down other parts work properly
- e.g. Using an SQS you can decouple the services so they are queues
- Instead of using a queue we can also use a load balancer for decoupling
- Loadbalancer is useful when the backend service retuns a response, if there is no response required queue can be used instead.
- Elastic IP address is a way of decoupling servers , when a service goes down. (It is a static ip address that can be moved around)

#### High Availability v/s Fault Tolerant
- Fault Tolerance is a higher bar
- Fault Tolerance means user does not see any performance degradadtion.

#### AWS Cloudformation
- Create a large dployment with many s3, EC2, dynamodb, etc.. and make multiple copies
- Cloud formation that lets you describe your infra as JSON templates, and converts them to infrastructure and call them stack.
- Also promotes resilience, easily relaunch you application from nothing.
- Cloud Formation is like your system DNA
- AMI IDs differ across reigons
- Use mappings to specify base AMI since AMI ids are different in each riegon

#### AWS Lambda
- Provide stateless code , AWS spins up containers on demand whenever you invoke it. (responds to event or a time based interval)
- A great way to increase scalability and resilience is using Lambda
- Lambda does not allow SSH access
- Lambda logs are shown up in Cloudwatch logs
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) - How long it takes for the sytem to recover
- RPO (Recovery Point in Object) - Loose data for that period of time. How much data was lost?

### Tips (Axioms)
- Single AZ will never be the right answer
- Using managed AWS services should always be preferred
- Fault Tolerant and High availability are not teh same thing
- Expect everything will fail at sometime and design systems accordingly

## Define Performant Architecture 

### Choose performant storage and databases
- EBS represents block storage , you cam mount EBS volumes as disks on your EC2 instance.
- SSD are more expensive , perform better for IOPS / random access
  - Provisioned IOPS is better from perf
- HDD are cheaper and perform better for sequential read/writes for database
  - Throughput Optimized are better from perf
- Offload all static content to S3 to dramatically improve your web server performance
  - Create a bucket in one of the reigons
  - Bucket name becomes the subdomain of the http url
  - Then you can upload any number of objects 
  - **Virtual hosted style url** bucket as part of the domain name
  - **Path url** bucket as the first style of the path
  - Buckets are always tied to a reigon, and are globally unique (noone else can have that name in any reigon)
  - full path after the bucket name is called the key
  - Pricing of bucket is based on 3 things - storage in gb/month, transfer out of reigon, API requests
  - Transfer into s3 and Transfer out of s3 to Cloudfront or the same reigon is free
  - Storage classes in s3 , s3 Standard and s3standardIA
  - cheaper storage for IA and has a 30 day storage minimum
  - s3 lifecycle policies delete or move your object based on age. cold data moved to IA
  - s3 does not replicate data across reigons, its a reigon scoped service. It replicats across AZs
  - Data from EBS is automatically replicated within an AZ
  
#### Design performant storage on databases  
 - Options 
   - Relational dabase using RDS
   - Managed nosql service using DynamoDB
   - Datawarehouse using Redshift, useful if you have analytical queries instead of transactional queries.
 - When to use RDS?
   - Managed relational database
   - You can choose from mysql, postgres, mariadb, aurora , sqlserver and oracle.
   - joins or other complex transactions or complex queries
   - a medium to hig query write/rate , lower than dynamodb
   - dont use for scaling/auto sharding
   - RDS master databse can be scaled by using bigger instance or using
   - Read replicas - offload your read request to read replicas. for  mysql, postgres, mariadb, aurora
 - DynamoDB
   - managed nosql db as a persistent datastore
   - auto scaling and automatically shard your data and split it across multiple servers
   - only specify throughput in rcu and wcu , read capacity unit is 1 read/sec for upto 4kb. write capacity unit for an item upto 1kb.
   - one strongly consistent read pe second.
   - you can get two eventually consistent read per second.
   - limitless storage by scaling horizontally, adding more servers
   - durability in both rds and dynamodb
   - customize the database us dynamodb

### Apply caching and improve performance
- low hanging fruit to improve performance
- Cache data at different levels
  - at a web level using a CDN such as cloudfront (will cache static content close to user) delvered from cloudfront edge location close to the user
  - If edge location does not have data gets it from cache
  - Caching at application and the databse level, you can elastic cache to cache what you would otherwise fetch from database.
- Elastic cache gives you two types pf services
  - memcached - is simpler and easier to setup, multithreading, easy horizontal scaling with auto discovery
  - redis - more sophesticated , more than a key value pair, support for specific data structures, persistence and atomic operations , cluster and sharded clusters
  
### Design solutions for elasticity and scalability
- **CloudFront** - speeding up content over the internet, is used for static and dynamic content. for ex serve content from web server with ttl as 0
- whats the benefit of using dynamic content on cloudfront ? not caching , request and response ride over AWS backbone instead of public internet.
- You can set up origins as S3 for static content.
- For dymanic content you can use EC2 , ELB or http server
- supports SSL
- Integrates with AWS shield , protects you from DDOS attacks. 
- Integrates with WAF (Web application firewall) which used for filtering requests based on type.
- **Vertical Scaling** when you replace a smaller instance with larger one,  also called scaling up and scaling down
- **Horizontal scaling** when you want to add more instances , also called scaling in and scaling out
- Use autoscaling for horizontal scaling , launch and terminate instances across AZs. 
- It can also automatically register instances with load balancers.
- Monitor instances using Cloudwatch, cpu utilization for example, we can set cloudwatch alarms. 
- Cloudwatch alarms are intercepted by auto scaling.
- The AS policy determines how many instances to launch and what kind of instenaces.
- Autoscaling needs uses launch configuration to launch a fully configured instance which has the AMI ID, Instance type, Key pair, user data etc..
- **Autoscaling** 
  - launch configuration specifies EC2 instance size, AMI name and other details
  - Auto scaling group specifies min and max instances, also desired instance (current setting), point it to a Load balancer and check health.
  - Auto scaling policy specifies how much to scale in and scale out.
  - attach multiple auto scaling policies to a auto scaling group.
- Auto scaling usescloudwatch to determine when to scale in and out.
- Cloudwatch can monitor metrics such as CPU utilization, netwrork metricsand queue size
- Cloudwatch has a feature called cloudwatch logs , which picks logs from EC2/Lambda or cloudtrail.
- You can use the logs for metrics.
- Provides default metrics for most services, also define custom metrics.
- Loadbalancer is used to distribute traffic across instances.
- Schedule to scale an instance so we can avoid the latency for scaling in or out.
- If an application optimally runs on 9 instances and must have 6 instances running instances minimally accepted performance, a desired capacity of 9 instances across 3 AZs is required. 

### Tips (Axioms)
- If data is unstructured use s3 as the storage solution.
- Use caching to strategically improve perrformance
- Know when and why to use ASG
- Choose the instance and the database type that make the most sense for workload and perf need.

## Specify Secure Applications and Architecture

### Best practices
- Determine how to secure application tiers
- Determine how to secure data
- Defining the networking infra for single VPC application 

#### Shared responsibility model
- Draws a line in your stack, below the line AWS is responsible and above the line the customer is 
- the principle of least privilige

#### AWS IAM
- Secure your resources using IAM
- lets you create users, groups and roles
- attach policies to these users , groups or roles.
- Integrate IAM with AD using Federation and AWS directory service using SAML federation.

#### Identities
- Exist in these forms: 
  - IAM users - within account
  - Roles - temporary identities assigned to users
  - Federation - use AD identities
  - Web Identity Federation - assign roles to users who have open id providers using (STS)Security Token Service
  
### Amazon VPC
- How do we secure our networking Infra in cloud? The key to this is VPC , which can be used to carve out private ip addresses fror our instances.
- Virtual Private Cloud
- organize VPC into subnets , which are subnetworks of private IP addresses
- Within our VPC we use subnet groups and ACLs to decide who can talk to whom
- We create Internet gateways, NAT gateways , Virtual private gateways for data to flow in and out of our VPC
- We determine connectivity using Routes

#### How to use Subnets
- **Public Subnets** - to support inbound and outbound access to the public internet, route tables should include an entry to an internet gateway
- **Private Subnet** - donot have an entry to an internet gateway, not directly accessible to public internet, outbound access they use a NAT instance or a NAT gateway. For inbound access they use a jump box or a bastion host.

- **There are two ways for restricting and allowing access in a VPC**
  - Security Groups act at the instance or infact the network interface level. They only let you allow traffic. SG are stateful, if request gets in response is allowed to go out. SG apply to network interfaces.
  - ACLs operate at the subnet level. Let you allow and deny traffic.ACLs are stateless. ACLs apply to subnets.
  - How do you seperate different tiers or componets ? Using SG. 
  - The good thing about SG is, SG can be allowed access through any instance or network interface from another SG. Just SG membership is enough to allow access.
  - SG can span multiple AZs
  - VPCs can too.
  - However niether can span rigeons.
  
  - **The services that can get traffic in oor out of your VPC**
  - Internet Gateway: connect to the internet
  - Virtual Private Gateway: connect to customer data centers using VPN
  - AWS Direct connect : dedicated pipe between AWS and customer data centers 
  - VPC peering : connect to other VPCs
  - NAT Gateways: allow outgoing traffic from private subnets

### Securing the Data tier
#### Security of Data in Transit
- In and out of AWS
- within AWS
- For data in transit we use one of the following:
  - SSL over web
  - VPN for IPsec
  - IPsec over AWS Direct connect
  - Import export snowball/ snowmobile.
- Data sent over AWS API uses SSL by default
#### Security of Data at rest
- data stores in S3 / EBS
  - data stored on S3 is private by default and requires AWS credentials for access
  - It can be accessed over http/https
  - There is an audit log of access to all objects 
  - You can lock down access through ACLs and policies at the bucket level or below
- Encryption of data : 
- Server side Encryption (transparent to your code) easier and more eficient
  - S3 managed keys SSE-S3
  - KMS-managed keys SSE-KMS
  - Customer provides keys SSE-C
- Client side encryption (encrypt before sending it to AWS services for compliance)
  - KMS Managed master encryption keys CSE-KMS
  - Customer Managed master encryption keys CSE-C
- Managing your keys
  - Key Management Service (KMS) integrates with most data related services in AWS
  - AWS Cloud HSM (hardware dedidicated appliance where you mange your keys)
- Taske that IAM policies can do: configure VPC security group, creating oracle DB, Creating an S3 bucket

### Tips (Axioms)
- Lock down the root user
- Security groups only allow, network ACLs allow explicit deny
- Prefer IAM roles to access keys.
## Design Cost Optimized Architecture
- Determine how to design cost optimized storage
- Determine how to design cost optimized compute
- Pay as you go
- pay less when you reserve
- pay even less per unit by using more
- Three main things you pay for : Compute , Storage and Data transfer

### Compute pricing works 
- hours the compute instance is running
- machine configuration
- machine purchase price - reserved instances / spot instances
- number of instances is going to impact the price
- load balancing and auto scaling can dynamically increase and decrease the instances
- Elastic IPs have a cost if they are not used
- Detailed monitoring that gives you cloud watch metrics
- OS and the software packages
- EC2 pricing is the function of an instance family

#### RI v/s Spot instances
- resrved instnces can be 75% cheaper than on demand
- types of RI: Standard / Convertible / Scheduled
- spot prices are dynamic
- Hibernate can allow the instance to sleep when the price is high
- Spot blocks - reserve a time of upto 6 hours in a spot market

### Storage pricing works 
- Storage Class / Storage / Requests / Data Transfer
- Standard storage -> Standard-IA -> Glacier

#### Consideration of cost for using EBS
- Volumes
- IOPs 
- Snapshots how frequently?
- Data Transfer 

#### SSD or HDD?
- SSD higer iops and are useful for random access (more expensive)
- HHD sequential access 

### Serverless Architecture
- With serverleass architecture you dont pay for the idle time of EC2 instance
- If your compute logic is lambda you pay per invocation, much better utilization of your resources
- s3 for static files
- lambda can use dynamo db for storing state
- You can use API gateway to attach rest endpoint to lambda so that it can be called over web or any browser or http client
- CloudFront can help you reduce your cost as well , you can avoid fetching the data from s3 by caching it on CloudFront 
- There is no data charge for moving data between s3 and cloudfront 
- You can also use cloudfront to offload data from some of the EC2 instances
- Cloudfront data can be spread across specific geographies ir globally 
It is also dependent on number of requests and data transfer cost 

### Tips (Axioms)
- If you know its going to be on , reserve it
- Any unused CPU time is a waste of money
- Use the most cost effective service data storage service and class
- Determine the most cost effective EC2 pricing model and instance type for each workload

## Define Operationally Excellent architecture
- The basic idea is to have a system that is automated and adapts to circumstantial changes
- The key practice are you prepare before you launch your system, to Operate it in an automated way and over time learn and evovle the sytem to continuously become better.
- Best Practices:
  - Perform operations with code
  - Automate the operations of infrastructure
  - Annotate documentation, frequently your documentation would consist of automated scripts. You want to annotate them so that your documentation is a live representation of what is deployed.
  - Make frequent , small reversible changes, you need to have a way to monitor your system. After making changes you observe how your system behaves.
  - Refine operations and procedures frequently , we want to constantly evolve our operations
  - Anticipate Failiure, we want to practice game day 
  - Learn from all operation failiures.
  
  ### Services that support OE
  - AWS Config = tracks resources such as EBS volumes and EC2 instances , it verifies that resources comply with your configuration rules. 
  - AWS Cloud Formation = converts json and yaml templates into infrastructure and resources. 
  - AWS Trusted Advisor = checks accounts for best practices on security, reliability , performance , cost and service limits.
  - AWS Inspector = check EC2 instances for security vulnerabilities
  - VPC Flowlogs = logs network traffic
  - AWS Cloud Trail = logs API calls
  - CloudWatch = tracks metrics and triggers alarms when metrics are breached , stores logs from EC2 instances, cloud trail and from lambda. It can also turn these log files into metrics by extracting patterns from log files.
  
  - VPClogs capture layer 3 and 4 IP-level logs and does not capture layer 7 http errors
 
### Tips (Axioms)
- IAM roles are easier and safer than keys and passwords
- Monitor metrics across the sytem
- Automate responses to metric wherever appropriate
- Provide alerts for anomalous conditions.
