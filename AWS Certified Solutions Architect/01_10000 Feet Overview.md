# AWS 10000 Feet Overview

![A History of Amazon Web Services](https://www.awsgeek.com/pages/AWS-History/)

## AWS history so far

  * **Andy Jesse** - CEO of Amazon Web Services and he said famously that invention requires two things one the ability to try a lot of experiments and two not having to live with the collateral damage of failed experiments.
  * In **2003 Chris Pinkman and Benjamin Black** presented a paper on what Amazon's own internal infrastructure should look like and they suggested selling it as a service and prepared a business case.
  * **SQS** launched in 2004 (first service)
  * **AWS launched in 2006** 
  * 2007 - 180,000 developers on the platform
  * **2010 all of Amazon.com moved over to Amazon Web Services.**
  * And by 2012 Amazon had their first reinvent conference.
  * 2013 - Certifications launched
  * 2014 - AWS was committed to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy usage for its global footprint.
  * 2015  - AWS broke out its revenue and they were making 6 billion US
  * 2016 - runrate of 13 billion US
  * 2017 - AWS re-invent releases a host of artifical intelligent services , runrate of 27 billion US
  * So these were services like Polly and lex.These are the things that power Alexa.They released sage maker which is a type of machine learning service.
  * 2018 - AWS launch Machine learning certificates and they had a heavy focus on automating and A.I. and AML.

  - A **Region** is geographical area consisting of 2 or more availability zones.

  - **Availability zone** is logical data center. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.

  - **Edge Locations** are CDN End Points for CloudFront. Many more edge locations exist than regions.
  
  - An Amazon Web Services availability zone is part of an AWS region. This is best thought of as one of a set of data centers in the same city. ... Edge location is Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint for AWS to cache contents and reduce latency. Availability zone is logical (not physical!) data center of AWS.

## The AWS Platform

  - **Networking & Content Delivery

      - **VPC** [know VPC in and out] – Virtual Data Center. You can have multiple VPCs per region. VPCs can also be connected to each other.

      - **Route53** – Amazon’s DNS Service

      - **CloudFront** – Content delivery network. Edge locations cache assets.

      - **Direct Connect** – Connect your physical DCs to AWS using dedicated telephone lines

  - **Compute 

      - **EC2** – Elastic Compute Cloud.

      - **EC2 Container Services** – supports Docker.

      - **Elastic Beanstalk** - Just upload your code here. Elastic Bean stalk will provision all infrastructure required.

      - **Lambda** Alexa, Echo devices rely on Lambda

      - **Lightsail** – Out of the box cloud – WordPress, Drupal

  - **Storage

      - **S3** - Object Store

      - **Glacier** – Archive files from S3 into Glacier – use when you don’t need immediate access to files

      - **EFS** (Elastic File Service) - Block Store - can be used for storing databases. It can be attached to multiple EC2 instances.

      - **Storage Gateway** (VM) - communicates between your data center and S3 storage.

  - **Databases

      - **RDS** ( MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, Aurora)

      - **DynamoDB** - Non relational DB (important for developer exam)

      - **Redshift**  - Data warehousing system  

      - **ElastiCache** - Cloud in-memory DB (important for developer / architect exam)

  - **Migration

      - **Snowball** - Transfer Data - next step over Export Import gateway. Store all your data from enterprise into Snowball and then ship to AWS. Also released Snowball edge – add compute capacity to storage device – so that you can run analytics on top of the huge dataset collected, without having to transfer to cloud. AWS Lambda is supported on Snowball edge.

      - **DMS** - Database migration services - migrate existing DBs to Cloud, also migrate existing Cloud DBs to other regions. Can migrate from Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL/ to Aurora.  

      - **SMS** - Server migration services - migrate existing VMs on premise to the Cloud -up to 50 concurrent ones.

  - **Analytics

      - **Athena** - allow SQL queries on S3. Run queries on csv files in S3 buckets.

      - **EMR** -Elastic Map Reduce - process large amounts of data. Based on Hadoop, Apache Spark. Log Analytics etc.

      - **Cloud Search** - Managed services provided by AWS

      - **Elastic Search** – Search service which uses the Elastic product

      - **Kinesis** - streaming and analysis real time data (important for architect exam). used for collating large amounts of data streamed from multiple sources

      - **Data Pipeline** - move data from one place to another. e.g. S3 into DynamoDB and vice versa

      - **Quick Sight**- BA tools for rich visualizations and dashboards.
