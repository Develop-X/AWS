## About AWS
* [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) is one of the three dominant public cloud computing providers.
* “[cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)” can refer to one of three types of cloud: “public,” “private,” and “hybrid.” AWS is a public cloud provider, since anyone can use it. Private clouds are within a single (usually large) organization. Many companies use a hybrid of private and public clouds.
* The core features of AWS are [infrastructure-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29) (IaaS) — that is, virtual machines and supporting infrastructure. Other cloud service models include [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Platform_as_a_service_.28PaaS.29) (PaaS), which typically are more fully managed services that deploy customers’ applications, or [software-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Software_as_a_service_.28SaaS.29) (SaaS), which are cloud-based applications. AWS does offer a few products that fit into these other models, too.
* In business terms, with infrastructure-as-a-service you have a variable cost model — it is [OpEx, not CapEx](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/what-difference-between-capex-and-opex.asp) (though some [pre-purchased contracts](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/) are still CapEx).

## Why Cloud Computing using AWS?
* If your company is building systems or products that may need to scale
* and you have technical know-how
* and you want the most flexible tools
* and you’re not significantly tied into different infrastructure already
* and you don’t have internal, regulatory, or compliance reasons you can’t use a public cloud-based solution
* and you’re not on a Microsoft-first tech stack (debatable)
* and you don’t have a specific reason to use Google Cloud
* and you can afford, manage, or negotiate its somewhat higher costs
