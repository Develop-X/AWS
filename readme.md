## Must know infrastructure 
* Most typical small to medium-size users will focus on the following services first. If you manage use of AWS systems, you likely need to know at least a little about all of these.

 [IAM](https://github.com/Develop-X/AWS/blob/master/IAM.md)	
 
 [EC2](EC2)	

 * [AMIs](AMIs)	

 * [Load Balancers](Load-Balancers)	

 * [Autoscaling](Autoscaling)

 * [EBS](EBS)

 * [Elastic IPs](Elastic-IPs)

 [CloudFront](CloudFront)	
 
 [CloudWatch](CloudWatch)	

## Managed services
* Existing software solutions you could run on your own, but with managed deployment:

 [RDS](RDS)	

 [EMR](EMR)

 [Elasticsearch](Elasticsearch)	

 [ElastiCache](ElastiCache)

## Optional but important infrastructure
* These are key and useful infrastructure components that are less widely known and used. You may have legitimate reasons to prefer alternatives, so evaluate with care to be sure they fit your needs

 [CloudTrail]()
 
 [CloudFormation]()
 
 [Elastic Beanstalk]()
 
 [EFS]()
 
 [ECS]()

 [EKS]()

 [ECR]()

 [Config]()

 [X-Ray]()
 
 ## Special-purpose infrastructure
 * These services are focused on specific use cases and should be evaluated if they apply to your situation. Many also are proprietary architectures, so tend to tie you to AWS.

  [Trusted Advisor]()
  
  [Certificate Manager]()
  
  [Fargate]()
  
 ## Compound services
 * These are similarly specific, but are full-blown services that tackle complex problems and may tie you in. Usefulness depends on your requirements. If you have large or significant need, you may have these already managed by in-house systems and engineering teams.

 [Device Farm]()
 
 [Mobile Analytics]()

## Enterprise services
 * These are relevant if you have significant corporate cloud-based or hybrid needs. Many smaller companies and startups use other solutions, like Google Apps or Box. Larger companies may also have their own non-AWS IT solutions.

## Probably-don't-need-to-know services
 * Bottom line, our informal polling indicates these services are just not broadly used — and often for good reasons

 ### Common Concepts

-	The AWS [**General Reference**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/Welcome.html) covers a bunch of common concepts that are relevant for multiple services.
-	AWS allows deployments in [**regions**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html), which are isolated geographic locations that help you reduce latency or offer additional redundancy. Regions contain availability zones(AZs), which are typically the first tool of choice for [high availability](#high-availability)). AZs are [physically separate from one another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIQETrFC_SQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1428) even within the same region, and [may span multiple physical data centers](https://blog.rackspace.com/aws-101-regions-availability-zones). While they are connected via low latency links, natural disasters afflicting one should not affect others.
-	Each service has API **endpoints** for each region. Endpoints differ from service to service and not all services are available in each region, as listed in [these tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).
-	[**Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) are specially formatted identifiers for identifying resources. They start with 'arn:' and are used in many services, and in particular for IAM policies.
