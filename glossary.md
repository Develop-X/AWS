#### A names

* **API Gateway** - is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create REST and WebSocket APIs that act as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication applications.

* **AMI** - An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.
An AMI includes the following:
  * One or more EBS snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
  * Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
  * A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.

* **Athena**: SQL queries on S3

* **API Gateway**: Acts as a door to create, publish, monitor, maintain, and secure API at scale using AWS.

An easy to use service for developing and scaling web apps developed in Java, Dot Net etc., we can simply upload the code and EB will automatically handle the deployment from capacity provisioning, load balancing, autoscaling, app health and monitoring.

* **Edge location**: This is a CDN(Content-Delivery Network) endpoint. Edge locations are used by CloudFront to cache files near the user where they access them.

* **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** is a load-balancing service for Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployments. ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic and scales resources to meet traffic demands.

* **EFS(Elastic File service)**: File based storage and you can share it, you can install databases, applications.

* **Elastic Cache**: Allows/offers an in-memory caching service for the AWS platform.

* **ElasticMapReduce(EMR)**:

  * Uses Hadoop, an open source framework to distribute your data and process across a resizeable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
  * It can also run other distributed framework such as Spark and Presto.
  * EMR is used in a variety of applications including log analysis, web-indexing, data warehousing, machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation, and Bioinformatics, customers launch millions of Amazon’s EMR clusters each year
  * Allows you root access(i.e. login via SSH)
  
* **Elastic Transcoder**:

  * A media transcoding service in the cloud.
  * Designed to be highly-scalable, easy to use in a cost-effective way for developers and businesses to convert or transcode media files from their source formats to version that will play on devices like smartphones, tablets etc.
