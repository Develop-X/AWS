# AWS Well-Architected Framework

* The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS
* Architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, eﬃcient, and cost-eﬀective systems in the cloud
* This framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology oﬃcers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members

* **The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on ﬁve pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance eﬃciency, and cost optimization.**

## The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework [OSRPC]

* **Operational Excellence** The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. 
* **Security** The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
* **Reliability** The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconﬁgurations or transient network issues. 
* **Performance Eﬃciency** The ability to use computing resources eﬃciently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that eﬃciency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
* **Cost Optimization** The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework uses these terms:

* A **component** is the code, conﬁguration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components. 
* We use the term **workload** to identify a set of components that together deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.
* **Milestones** mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, testing, go live, and in production).
* We think about **architecture** as being how components work together in a workload. How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams. 
* Within an organization the **technology portfolio** is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.
