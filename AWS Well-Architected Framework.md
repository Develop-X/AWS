* The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions you make while building systems on AWS
* Architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, eﬃcient, and cost-eﬀective systems in the cloud
* This framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology oﬃcers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members

* **The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on ﬁve pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance eﬃciency, and cost optimization.**

## The pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework [OSRPC]

* **Operational Excellence** The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. 
* **Security** The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
* **Reliability** The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconﬁgurations or transient network issues. 
* **Performance Eﬃciency** The ability to use computing resources eﬃciently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that eﬃciency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
* **Cost Optimization** The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework uses these terms:

* A **component** is the code, conﬁguration and AWS Resources that together deliver against a requirement. A component is often the unit of technical ownership, and is decoupled from other components. 
* We use the term **workload** to identify a set of components that together deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about.
* **Milestones** mark key changes in your architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle (design, testing, go live, and in production).
* We think about **architecture** as being how components work together in a workload. How components communicate and interact is often the focus of architecture diagrams. 
* Within an organization the **technology portfolio** is the collection of workloads that are required for the business to operate.

## On Architecture
* In on-premises environments customers often have a **central team** for technology architecture that acts as an overlay to other product or feature teams to ensure they are following best practice. Technology architecture teams are often composed of a set of roles such as **Technical Architect (infrastructure), Solutions Architect (software), Data Architect, Networking Architect, and Security Architect**. Often these teams use **TOGAF or the Zachman Framework** as part of an enterprise architecture capability.

* At AWS, we prefer to **distribute capabilities** into teams rather than having a centralized team with that capability. There are **risks when you choose to distribute decision making authority**, for example, ensuring that teams are meeting internal standards. We mitigate these risks in two ways. 
  * First, we have **practices** that focus on enabling each team to have that capability, and we put in place experts who ensure that teams raise the bar on the standards they need to meet. 
  * Second, we implement **mechanisms** that carry out automated checks to ensure standards are being met. This distributed approach is supported by the **Amazon leadership principles**, and establishes a culture across all roles that works back from the customer. **Customerobsessed teams** build products in response to a customer need.
* For architecture this means that we expect every team to have the capability to create architectures and to follow best practices. To help new teams gain these capabilities or existing teams to raise their bar, we enable access to a **virtual community of principal engineers** who can review their designs and help them understand what AWS best practices are. The **principal engineering community** works to make best practices visible and accessible. One way they do this, for example, is through lunchtime talks that focus on applying best practices to real examples. These talks are recorded and can be used as part of onboarding materials for new team members.
* AWS best practices emerge from our experience running thousands of systems at internet scale. We prefer to use data to deﬁne best practice, but we also use **subject matter experts like principal engineers to set them**. **As principal engineers see new best practices emerge they work as a community to ensure that teams follow them**. In time, these best practices are formalized into our **internal review processes**, as well as into mechanisms that enforce compliance. Well-Architected is the customerfacing implementation of our internal review process, where we have codiﬁed our principal engineering thinking across ﬁeld roles like Solutions Architecture and internal engineering teams. Well-Architected is a scalable mechanism that lets you take advantage of these learnings.

* **“Good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen” Jeﬀ Bezos. This means replacing humans best eﬀorts with mechanisms (often automated) that check for compliance with rules or process.**
* **Working backward is a fundamental part of our innovation process. We start with the customer and what they want, and let that deﬁne and guide our eﬀorts.**

## General Design Principles

*  **Stop guessing your capacity needs**: Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before you deploy a system, you might end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with the performance implications of limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems can go away. You can use as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down automatically. 
* **Test systems at production scale**: In the cloud, you can create a production-scale test environment on demand, complete your testing, and then decommission the resources. Because you only pay for the test environment when it's running, you can simulate your live environment for a fraction of the cost of testing on premises. 
* **Automate to make architectural experimentation easier**: Automation allows you to create and replicate your systems at low cost and avoid the expense of manual eﬀort. You can track changes to your automation, audit the impact, and revert to previous parameters when necessary. 
* **Allow for evolutionary architectures**: Allow for evolutionary architectures. In a traditional environment, architectural decisions are often implemented as static, one-time events, with a few major versions of a system during its lifetime. As a business and its context continue to change, these initial decisions might hinder the system's ability to deliver changing business requirements. In the cloud, the capability to automate and test on demand lowers the risk of impact from design changes. This allows systems to evolve over time so that businesses can take advantage of innovations as a standard practice.
* **Drive architectures using data**: In the cloud you can collect data on how your architectural choices aﬀect the behavior of your workload. This lets you make fact-based decisions on how to improve your workload. Your cloud infrastructure is code, so you can use that data to inform your architecture choices and improvements over time. 
* **Improve through game days**: Test how your architecture and processes perform by regularly scheduling game days to simulate events in production. This will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help develop organizational experience in dealing with events.

# The Five Pillars of the Framework
## Operational Excellence 
* The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures. The operational excellence pillar provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and questions
### Design Principles 
* There are six design principles for operational excellence in the cloud: 
  * **Perform operations as code**: In the cloud, you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire environment. You can deﬁne your entire workload (applications, infrastructure) as code and update it with code. You can implement your operations procedures as code and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent responses to events. 
  * **Annotate documentation**: In an on-premises environment, documentation is created by hand, used by people, and hard to keep in sync with the pace of change. In the cloud, you can automate the creation of annotated documentation after every build (or automatically annotate hand-crafted documentation). Annotated documentation can be used by people and systems. Use annotations as an input to your operations code. 
  * **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**: Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without aﬀecting customers when possible). 
  * **Reﬁne operations procedures frequently**: As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. As you evolve your workload, evolve your procedures appropriately. Set up regular game days to review and validate that all procedures are eﬀective and that teams are familiar with them. 
  * **Anticipate failure**: Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are eﬀective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.
  * **Learn from all operational failures**: Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization.  

### Best Practices 
#### Prepare
* Eﬀective preparation is required to drive operational excellence. Business success is enabled by shared goals and understanding across the business, development, and operations. Common standards simplify workload design and management, enabling operational success. **Design workloads with mechanisms to monitor and gain insight into application, platform, and infrastructure components, as well as customer experience and behavior**.
* Create mechanisms to validate that workloads, or changes, are ready to be moved into production and supported by operations. Operational readiness is validated through checklists to ensure a workload meets deﬁned standards and that required procedures are adequately captured in **runbooks and playbooks**. Validate that there are suﬃcient trained personnel to eﬀectively support the workload. Prior to transition, test responses to operational events and failures. Practice responses in supported environments through failure injection and game day events. 
* AWS enables operations as code in the cloud and the ability to safely experiment, develop operations procedures, and practice failure. Using **AWS CloudFormation enables you to have consistent, templated, sandbox development, test, and production environments with increasing levels of operations control**. AWS enables visibility into your workloads at all layers through various log collection and monitoring features. **Data on use of resources, application programming interfaces (APIs), and network ﬂow logs can be collected using Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs.** You can use the collectd plugin, or the CloudWatch Logs agent, to aggregate information about the operating system into CloudWatch.
* The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence.:
  * **OPS 1:  How do you determine what your priorities are?** Everyone needs to understand their part in enabling business success. Have shared goals in order to set priorities for resources. This will maximize the beneﬁts of your eﬀorts. 
  * **OPS 2:  How do you design your workload so that you can understand its state?** Design your workload so that it provides the information necessary for you to understand its internal state (for example, metrics, logs, and traces) across all components. This enables you to provide eﬀective responses when appropriate. 
  * **OPS 3:  How do you reduce defects, ease remediation, and improve ﬂow into production?** Adopt approaches that improve ﬂow of changes into production, that enable refactoring, fast feedback on quality, and bug ﬁxing. These accelerate beneﬁcial changes entering production, limit issues deployed, and enable rapid identiﬁcation and remediation of issues introduced through deployment activities.
  * **OPS 4:  How do you mitigate deployment risks?** Adopt approaches that provide fast feedback on quality and enable rapid recovery from changes that do not have desired outcomes. Using these practices mitigates the impact of issues introduced through the deployment of changes. 
  * **OPS 5:  How do you know that you are ready to support a workload?** Evaluate the operational readiness of your workload, processes and procedures, and personnel to understand the operational risks related to your workload.

#### Operate 
* Successful operation of a workload is measured by the achievement of business and customer outcomes. **Deﬁne expected outcomes, determine how success will be measured**, and identify the workload and operations metrics that will be used in those calculations to determine if operations are successful. **Consider that operational health includes both the health of the workload and the health and success of the operations acting upon the workload (for example, deployment and incident response)**. Establish baselines from which improvement or degradation of operations will be identiﬁed, collect and analyze your metrics, and then validate your understanding of operations success and how it changes over time. Use collected metrics to determine if you are satisfying customer and business needs, and identify areas for improvement. 
* Eﬃcient and eﬀective management of operational events is required to achieve operational excellence. This applies to both planned and unplanned operational events. **Use established runbooks for well-understood events, and use playbooks to aid in the resolution of other events.** Prioritize responses to events based on their business and customer impact. **Ensure that if an alert is raised in response to an event, there is an associated process to be executed, with a speciﬁcally identiﬁed owner**. Deﬁne in advance the personnel required to resolve an event and include escalation triggers to engage additional personnel, as it becomes necessary, based on impact (that is, duration, scale, and scope). Identify and engage individuals with the authority to decide on courses of action where there will be a business impact from an event response not previously addressed. 
* Communicate the operational status of workloads through dashboards and notiﬁcations that are tailored to the target audience (for example, customer, business, developers, operations) so that they may take appropriate action, so that their expectations are managed, and so that they are informed when normal operations resume. 
* Determine the root cause of unplanned events and unexpected impacts from planned events. This information will be used to update your procedures to mitigate future occurrence of events. Communicate root cause with aﬀected communities as appropriate. 
* AWS provides workload insights through logging capabilities including AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs enabling the identiﬁcation of workload issues in support of root cause analysis and remediation.
* The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence:
  * **OPS 6:  How do you understand the health of your workload?** Deﬁne, capture, and analyze workload metrics to gain visibility to workload events so that you can take appropriate action. 
  * **OPS 7:  How do you understand the health of your operations?** Deﬁne, capture, and analyze operations metrics to gain visibility to operations events so that you can take appropriate action. 
  * **OPS 8:  How do you manage workload and operations events?** Prepare and validate procedures for responding to events to minimize their disruption to your workload.
* Routine operations, as well as responses to unplanned events, should be automated. 
* Manual processes for deployments, release management, changes, and rollbacks should be avoided. 
* Releases should not be large batches that are done infrequently. 
* Rollbacks are more diﬃcult in large changes. Failing to have a rollback plan, or the ability to mitigate failure impacts, will prevent continuity of operations. 
* Align metrics to business needs so that responses are eﬀective at maintaining business continuity.
* One-time decentralized metrics with manual responses will result in greater disruption to operations during unplanned events. 

#### Evolve
* Evolution of operations is required to sustain operational excellence. **Dedicate work cycles to making continuous incremental improvements.** Regularly evaluate and prioritize opportunities for improvement (for example, feature requests, issue remediation, and compliance requirements), including both the workload and operations procedures. **Include feedback loops within your procedures to rapidly identify areas for improvement and capture learnings from the execution of operations.**
* Share lessons learned across teams to share the beneﬁts of those lessons. **Analyze trends within lessons learned and perform cross-team retrospective analysis of operations metrics to identify opportunities and methods for improvement**. Implement changes intended to bring about improvement and evaluate the results to determine success
* With AWS Developer Tools you can implement continuous delivery build, test, and deployment activities that work with a variety of source code, build, testing, and deployment tools from AWS and third parties. The results of deployment activities can be used to identify opportunities for improvement for both deployment and development. You can perform analytics on your metrics data integrating data from your operations and deployment activities, to enable analysis of the impact of those activities against business and customer outcomes. This data can be leveraged in cross-team retrospective analysis to identify opportunities and methods for improvement.
* The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence.
  *  **How do you evolve operations?** Dedicate time and resources for continuous incremental improvement to evolve the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of your operations.
### Key AWS Services
* **The AWS service that is essential to Operational Excellence is AWS CloudFormation**, which you can use to create templates based on best practices. This enables you to provision resources in an orderly and consistent fashion from your development through production environments. 
* The following services and features support the three areas in operational excellence: 
  * **Prepare**: AWS Conﬁg and AWS Conﬁg rules can be used to create standards for workloads and to determine if environments are compliant with those standards before being put into production. 
  * **Operate**: Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor the operational health of a workload. 
  * **Evolve**: Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) allows you to analyze your log data to gain actionable insights quickly and securely. 

## Security
* The Security pillar includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. The security pillar provides an overview of design principles, best practices, and questions.

### Design Principles
* There are seven design principles for security in the cloud: 
  * **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize privilege management and reduce or even eliminate reliance on long-term credentials.
  * **Enable traceability**: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action. 
  * **Apply security at all layers**: Rather than just focusing on protection of a single outer layer, apply a defense-in-depth approach with other security controls. Apply to all layers (e.g., edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, every instance, operating system, and application). 
  * **Automate security best practices**: Automated software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and cost eﬀectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls that are deﬁned and managed as code in version-controlled templates. 
  * **Protect data in transit and at rest**: Classify your data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and access control where appropriate. 
  * **Keep people away from data**: Create mechanisms and tools to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This reduces the risk of loss or modiﬁcation and human error when handling sensitive data. 
  * **Prepare for security events**: Prepare for an incident by having an incident management process that aligns to your organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery. 

### Deﬁnition 
* There are ﬁve best practice areas for security in the cloud: 
* 1. Identity and Access Management 
* 2. Detective Controls 
* 3. Infrastructure Protection 
* 4. Data Protection 
* 5. Incident Response 

### Best Practices 
#### Identity and Access Management 
* Identity and access management are key parts of an information security program, ensuring that only authorized and authenticated users are able to access your resources, and only in a manner that you intend. For example, you should deﬁne principals (that is, users, groups, services, and roles that take action in your account), build out policies aligned with these principals, and implement strong credential management. These privilege-management elements form the core of authentication and authorization. 
* In AWS, privilege management is primarily supported by the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service, which allows you to control user and programmatic access to AWS services and resources. You should apply granular policies, which assign permissions to a user, group, role, or resource. You also have the ability to require strong password practices, such as complexity level, avoiding re-use, and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA). You can use federation with your existing directory service. For workloads that require systems to have access to AWS, IAM enables secure access through roles, instance proﬁles, identity federation, and temporary credentials.
* The following questions focus on these considerations for security.
  * **SEC 1:  How do you manage credentials and authentication?** Credentials and authentication mechanisms include passwords, tokens, and keys that grant access directly or indirectly in your workload. Protect credentials with appropriate mechanisms to help reduce the risk of accidental or malicious use. 
  * **SEC 2:  How do you control human access?** Control human access by implementing controls inline with deﬁned business requirements to reduce risk and lower the impact of unauthorized access. This applies to privileged users and administrators of your AWS account, and also applies to end users of your application 
  * **SEC 3:  How do you control programmatic access?** Control programmatic or automated access with appropriately deﬁned, limited, and segregated access to help reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Programmatic access includes access that is internal to your workload, and access to AWS related resources.
